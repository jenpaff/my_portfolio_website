# my_portfolio_website
This repository was born as part of a hackathon I organised during summer 2020 as an effort to teach some lovely ladies how to build and host their own website, here's the steps we followed:

## Step 1: IDEATION - Who's going to visit your website? 
My colleague and amazingly talented Experience Designer [Xiaofan Yan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaofan-yan-67b335a7/) created a few slides for you to think about the goal of your website. You can find the slides in the repository, take your time and read through it. Whenever you're ready, continue with step 2. 

## Step 2: DEVELOPING - Build a responsive portfolio website from scratch
During our remote hackathon, we followed [this Udemny Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/portfolio-website/) to create our portfolio website.Â Obviously feel free to add the sections you feel are important for your website, e.g. some of us skipped the technical sections & stats and focused on the portfolio section instead. Another advise I could give you, just follow this course to create a skeleton to get a feel of how to create a website. You can always change the look & feel in another iteration. 

## Step 3: HOSTING - Host your website with Netlify 
With netlify you can host your website via github in a few clicks by [following this tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/). 

## Step 4 - PERFECTION: 
Here are a few steps that I took to tweak my portfolio website. 

### Get a custom domain
Netlify gives you a *.netlify.app url*, however there's lots of places where you can get a domain for about EUR15/year. 

### Use jekyll 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. You will find as you add your personal content that the index.html will grow huge and e.g. your portfolio section will become cumbersome to maintain. With jekyll you can define a template and just add text in form of `.md`. Feel free to checkout [my website github repo](https://github.com/jenpaff/jennifer-codes_com) to see how I structured my website code and how I maintained it. 

### Change the style as you please
I was inspired by Xiaofans slides and chose a gradient color scheme see www.jennifer-codes.com
